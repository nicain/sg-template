Contributing:
Your public facing project should have a statement about what level of support
users should expect. Here are 4 example suggestions about a level of support
notification you could include on your github repo; by default the first example
(no expectation of support) is included in README.md, but feel free to
customize:
    
    1. We are not currently supporting this code, but simply releasing it
    to the community AS IS but are not able to provide any guarantees of
    support.  The community is welcome to submit issues, but you should not
    expect an active response.

    2. We are planning on occasional updating
    this tool with no fixed schedule. Community involvement is encouraged
    through both issues and pull requests.

    3. This code is an important
    part of the internal Allen Institute code base and we are actively using and
    maintaining it. Issues are encouraged, but because this tool is so central
    to our mission pull requests might not be accepted if they conflict with our
    existing plans.

    4. We are releasing this code to the public as a tool
    we expect others to use. Issues are welcomed and we expect to address them
    promptly, pull requests will vetted by our staff before inclusion.
